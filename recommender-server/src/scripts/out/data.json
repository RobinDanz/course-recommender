It is challenging to design and run computing systems that guarantee users\u2019 performance requirements in a resource-efficient way. Various quantitative methods are applied to capture such complex system dynamics and predict metrics of interests, from the designing phase of the systems to the runtime performance, e.g., job response times and system anomalies. To optimize the performance of computing systems, a deep understanding of those methods and their applications on the system design is essential. Having practical hand-on experience on designing experiments, deriving models, and validating results with benchmark systems will prepare students to tackle challenges of real-world systems.\nCourse topics include:\n\t1. Design of experiments and statistical tests.\n\t2. Operational laws and queueing methods for modelling computing systems.\n\t3. Scheduling and load balancing.\n\t4. Machine learning methods for modelling computing systems.\n\t5. System dependability and scalability analysis.\n\t6. Optimization and resource management.\n"

In this lecture, we will investigate some of the main technologies, which will shape the future of Internet from a software engineering perspective. This journey will start with a recap of web basics such as URIs, HTTP, JSON; then continue with web services (WS) with a strong focus on RESTful ones and some notions of asynchronous programming with event loops. We will conclude with actual topics such as the Web of Things (WoT), cloud computing, advanced databases and smart contracts.\nThe theoretical part of the lecture is accompanied by a larger software project, where you will apply your new knowledge to design and implement a state of the art web application, complete with a web-based UI and a service-driven application logic using languages such as Python and/or Node.JS, smart devices such as Thingy:91 boxes of environmental sensors and Node-RED workflow engine. The project will be developed by groups of four students following a strict agile methodology (SCRUM) and will count for half of your grade. For a successful completion of the project, good programming skills are an absolute must. The latter will be tested after three weeks on an individual basis within a first pass or fail small REST server application project.\n"

By abstracting from the details of the underlying computer architecture, higher-level languages aim at making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language. Modern languages offer us a variety of different concepts for expressing (executable) programs. Domain-specific (modeling) languages are even created specifically to solve problems in a particular domain of interest. However, programs written in a higher-level language must be translated into a lower-level, executable representation, which requires various forms of compilers doing this job for us.\n"

Following lectures for introducing the foundations of the technologies, students will set up their own projects and regularly report upon the advancement in the projects in the form of common presentations. At the end, final presentations of the projects including working prototypes and the submission of a seminal report based on scientific standards are required. For the implementation of the prototypes it is necessary to dispose of programming knowledge, e.g. in Java, Node.js, or Python.\n"

        "description": "Machine learning systems are often conventionally designed for centralized processing in that they first collect data from distributed sources and then execute algorithms on a single server. Due to the limited scalability of processing large amount of data and the long latency delay, there is a strong demand for a paradigm shift to distributed or decentralized ML systems which execute ML algorithms on multiple and in some cases even geographically dispersed nodes. The aim of this seminar course is to let students learn how to design and build distributed ML systems via paper reading, presentation, discussion, and project prototyping. We provide a broad overview on the design of the state-of-the-art distributed ML systems, with a strong focus on the scalability, resource efficiency, data requirements, and robustness of the solutions. We will present an array of methodologies and techniques that can efficiently scale ML analysis to a large number of distributed nodes against all operation conditions, e.g., system failures and malicious attacks. The specific course topics are listed below. The course materials will be based on a mixture of classic and recently published papers. For each topic, the basic concepts and technology landscape will be first provided and then two state-of-the art of papers will be presented and discussed by students. Course topics include:\n\t1. Distributed machine learning systems\n\t2. Federated machine learning systems\n\t3. Performance and scalability of state-of-the-art systems\n"

        "description": "To meet various customer requirements, to ensure availability on different platforms, or to satisfy business goals and marketing strategies, today\u2019s software products typically need to be released in multiple variants. As a consequence, software development is faced with the challenge of producing and maintaining flexible software systems which can be customized through several configuration options. This fact may result in many combinations of configuration options which may too many to maintain an overview of the entirety of software variants that implement these configurations. For the Linux kernel, a prominent example of a highly configurable software system, we may easily create a dedicated variant for every person on earth \u2013 it is even assumed that we could create more Linux variants than atoms in the universe.\nIn this lecture, we gradually dive into the active research field of engineering software product lines. After reviewing classical approaches for developing variable software in an ad-hoc manner, we introduce systematic methods and techniques amenable to software mass-customization by generating individual software products based on an integrated platform, following the idea of product line engineering known from traditional manufacturing and engineering disciplines. The course demonstrates how configurability of software systems can be modeled and analyzed, which variability implementation techniques can be used by fostering software reuse and dedicated variation points, and which strategies allow for testing the huge number of software variants that exponentially grows with the number of configuration options.\n"

After having dealt with the general concepts of verification and several small example system models, we will extend the concept of verification to digital systems that control systems in the physical world. The resulting models will contain a part that describes the digital system plus a part describing physical properties of the system (the combination of a digital system with a physical system is called a cyber-physical system or a hybrid system).\n"

        "description": "Document Image Analysis (DIA) is a cross-domain of computer vision and pattern recognition and refers to an established research field dealing with the extraction of any kind of exploitable information from document images. Printed and handwritten text recognition, known as OCR/ICR (Optical/Intelligent Character recognition), is part of the discipline, but represents only one aspect. Other challenging topics include document classification, layout analysis, writer identification/authentication, signature recognition, table recognition, logical structure recognition, etc.\nThe aim of the Master course is to provide an overview of methods, from basic image processing to machine learning, which are described in the scientific literature to address different steps of DIA; this includes image binarization, page segmentation, graphics/text separation, text bock and text line detection, feature extraction and classification (at various levels). As a practical exercise, students will be asked to do a project (either individually or within a group of max. 4 peoples), which addresses a specific DIA challenge, including potentially the participation to international competitions.\n"

        "description": "The aim of pattern recognition (PR) is to research methods that are able to (partially) imitate the human capacity of perception and intelligence. PR algorithms are actually employed in various applications (from handwriting recognition to activity predictions for molecular compounds). The question how to represent the underlying data in a formal way is a key issue in PR and related fields. In general, there are two major ways to tackle this step, viz. the statistical approach (using feature vectors) and the structural approach (using graphs). Graphs provide two seminal advantages when compared to feature vectors:\n\t1. Graphs are not only able to describe properties, but also relationships among different parts of the underlying data.\n\t2. Graphs are not constrained to a fixed size, i.e. the number of nodes and edges can be adapted to the size and the complexity of each individual data object\nDue to their power and flexibility, graphs have found widespread application in PR. A prominent example of entities, which can be formally represented in a more suitable and natural way by means of graphs rather than with feature vectors, are chemical compounds.\nThe field of graph based pattern recognition has a long tradition and can roughly be subdivided into three main eras:\n\t1. First era: Graph matching and graph clustering\n\t2. Second era: Graph kernels\n\t3. Third era: Graph neural networks\nThis lecture is structured along these three eras (in twelve Chapters). The course includes practical exercises in which the concepts and models presented in the lectures can be implemented and tested on real data.\n"

        "description": "How would your computer respond if you looked frustrated, upset or stressed? Could your phone comfort you if you were sad after getting a call? Could your smart home adjust the music, lighting, or other aspects of the environment around you after you\u2019ve had a bad day at work \u2014 without being asked?[1] Can your computer offer you help if it sees you stressed without the need of your assistance?\nThe goal of this seminar is to study some of the latest advances in emotion recognition and emphatic behaviour change as well as emphatic companions. Moreover responses generally and empathic responses specifically will be studied. In this context a special case is considered which is \u201cstress\u201d, a body and mental effect that we face daily. Two types of stress exist: the negative known as distress and the positive one known as eustress.\nEmpathy is the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within the other person\u2019s frame of reference, i.e., the capacity to place oneself in another\u2019s position [2], [3]. Despite there are still many definitions for empathy that encompass a broad range of emotional states, nowadays there is considerable agreement in the research community that empathy consists of three different aspects [4]: recognizing someone else\u2019s emotional state (i.e., cognitive empathy), the convergence of feelings between people (i.e., emotional convergence), and responding to another person\u2019s (inferred) feelings or the emotional convergence those feelings initiate (i.e., empathic responding).\nStress is a tension and pressure felt in the body that might be affecting positively or negatively our mental and physical health. By mental health we mean our emotional state, mood and behaviour, by physical health we mean the body, diet, weight and sleep etc. Stress is affecting every individual so what are the advantages of positive stress, and disadvantages of negative stress? What are the effects that can be seen in the body? What type of emotions can induced by stress, can it change our mood and behaviour?\nHuman emotions recognition is a complex task, stress is much more complex as well. Body and face temperature change, facial expressions, body language and voice tone, all these are examples of features related to the emotional state and stress reactional effects of a person.\nThis seminar will investigate how we can recognize human emotion and stress (using facial expression, physiological signals, etc.) and design interactive technologies and empathic companions to enhance quality of life and support the user during their daily activities (e.g. reduce cumulative stress at work, boost positive stress to increase performances, manage stress in semi-autonomous driving, etc.). This seminar will help the students to improve their research and practical abilities. It will have a strong practical component as students will investigate existing applications as well as develop new concepts in the aforementioned domains.\n"

        "description": "Nowadays, chatbots (or conversational agents) are available on different platforms. It can be in a professional context (Skype, Slack) or a private one (Facebook Messenger, Discord, Telegram). Since Facebook\u2019s F8 2016 conference, these bots have become more democratic and have flooded the different platforms. They tend to replace mobile applications for their ease of use and various functionalities. In addition, there is no need to install them because they are available on apps that everyone already has.\nTransactional chatbots are all over the place and are the first step of chatbots. We now search for more human-like conversations, with emotions, understanding and eventually empathy. We want to coach the user, to understand him, to help him, depending on the context (eg. customer service, mental illness treatment, coach, companion). Thanks to the outstanding evolutions in artificial intelligence and natural language processing in the last decade, it is now possible to converse in a more or less natural way with bots.\nThis seminar focuses on investigating approaches and technologies used in today\u2019s chatbots, as well as comparing and applying underlying psychological theories. There are different types of bot for different uses. It is then worthwhile to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each of these techniques. All bots are not powered by machine learning, some are rule-based. Natural language understanding as well as natural language generation are two fundamental aspects of chatbots. Monitoring a context in a conversation is also a very important element. Analyzing and designing a human-machine interface is not an easy task. Bots can have moods and a personality. All these aspects must be considered while designing a chatbot.\nA particular emphasis this year will be given to mood, personality and language generation.\n"

Complex systems are usually developed with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and can embed different kinds of models and algorithms including Machine Learning and Deep Learning, which make these systems difficult to understand for the user. This assumption is for instance particularly true in the field of automated driving since the level of automation is increasing or in the health domain where more and more sophisticated AI powered diagnostic tools are used every day. In order to better understand how AI works and build trust in the decisions made by AIs, new techniques in the field are emerging that are referred to as Explainable AI (XAI) [1].\n\t1. understand the functioning of algorithms and AIs in order to optimize their design and architecture, their features but also to understand and interpret the results\n\t2. increase human confidence in systems\n\t3. increase and improve cooperation between agents\nAs shown by [2], providing appropriate explanations to the user increases the user\u2019s confidence in the system and thus allows for better human-IA collaboration.\nThe goal of this seminar is to investigate the field of Explainable AI (XAI) with a particular focus on the perspective of human interaction since it has not been sufficiently studied in existing explainable approaches [1] [3]. The seminar will address the topics related to the design of human-computer interfaces for XAI. Effective knowledge transfer through an explanation depends on a combination of AI algorithms used, explanation dialogues, and interfaces that can accommodate explanations.\nThis seminar will help the students to improve their research and practical abilities. It will have a strong practical component as students will investigate existing applications as well as develop new concepts in the aforementioned domains.\n"

The common abstraction of the indefinite running time of such systems is the assumption that they run forever, leading to automata models operating on infinite sequences or trees. We will explore different equivalent models of automata on infinite words, namely B\u00fcchi, Muller, and Rabin Automata. We will learn how to manipulate them algorithmically, and explore their relation to logic, in particular to the monadic second-order logic of one successor. Finally, we will look at what changes, when these automata are applied to infinite trees rather than infinite words.\n"

This important subdomain of mathematical programming and extension of linear programming considers the problem of optimizing a linear function of many variables, some or all of them restricted to be integers, subject to linear constraints.\nInteger programming is a thriving area of optimization. It has countless applications in production planning and scheduling, logistics, layout planning and revenue management, to name just a few. Thanks to effective and reliable software, it is widely applied in industry to improve decision-making.\nIn this course, we cover the theory and practice of integer programming. In the first part, we address mathematical modeling aspects. We discuss how integer variables can be used to model various practically relevant, complex decision problems. We then introduce some standard optimization problems and develop, analyze and compare different integer programming formulations for them. We also introduce powerful modeling and solving tools and test them on the optimization problems given in the course. In the second part, we address optimization aspects, in which we discuss the basic methodology applied to solve integer programs. In particular, we consider implicit enumeration techniques (branch and bound), polyhedral theory, cutting planes and primal heuristics. We also look at some advanced techniques, such as Danzig-Wolfe decomposition and column generation.\n"

        "description": "Choice-based optimization enable planners to make decisions while taking into account individual\u2019s choice behavior. This behavior is modeled with discrete choice models, which correspond to the state-of-the-art of the disaggregate mathematical representation of the demand. They assume that each individual associates a utility with each alternative they can choose from and selects the one with the highest alternative.\nChoice-based optimization problems are receiving increasing attention because they allow to explicitly capture the interplay between the planner\u2019s decisions and the expected demand provided that the decisions are explanatory variables of the discrete choice model. In this course, we first introduce discrete choice models by reviewing their assumptions, mathematical formulations and applications. We then discuss how they can be integrated in an optimization problem by expressing the discrete choice model as a set of linear constraints that can be embedded in a mixed-integer linear formulation (i.e., linear model with both integer and continuous variables). We then apply the introduced modelling techniques in the context of revenue management, one of the application areas where the demand representation plays a very important role in the associated decision-making processes. Revenue management refers to the pricing and revenue optimization as a quantitative approach to set and update pricing and product availability decisions in a consistent and effective fashion. It has proven particularly successful in the airline industry, where fares and ticket offerings dynamically change as a function of the number of free seats, forecast of future demand and specific request characteristics. We introduce the basics on pricing with and without a capacity constraint, then discuss price differentiation aspects and look at revenue optimization problems including customer segmentation. From these single resource problems, we move to the network case, in which multiple resources are used to provide a service. We look at these revenue management topics from a choice-based optimization perspective concerning their modeling, solving and interpretation.\n"

With today\u2019s information overload, it has become increasingly difficult to analyze the huge amounts of data and to generate appropriate management decisions. Furthermore, the data are often imprecise and will include both quantitative and qualitative elements. For these reasons it is important to extend traditional decision making processes by adding intuitive reasoning, human subjectivity and imprecision.\nTo deal with uncertainty, vagueness, and imprecision, Lotfi A. Zadeh introduced fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic. In this series fuzzy logic is applied to extend and model portfolio analysis, scoring methods, customer relationship management, performance measurement, web reputation, web analytics and controlling, community marketing and other business domains to improve managerial decisions. Thus, fuzzy logic can be seen as a modeling and management method where appropriate concepts, software tools and languages build a powerful instrument for analyzing and controlling the business.\n"

        "description": "Recommender systems (RSs) are computer-based techniques that attempt to present information about products that are likely to be of interest to a user. These techniques are mainly used in Electronic Commerce (eCommerce) in order to provide suggestions on items that a customer is, presumably, going to like. Nevertheless, there are other applications that make use of RSs, such as social networks and community-building processes, among others. A recommender system is a specific type of information filtering technique that tries to present users with information about items (movies, music, books, news, web pages, among others) in which they are interested. The term \u201citem\u201d is used to denote what the system recommends to users. To achieve this goal, the user profile is contrasted with the characteristics of the items. These features may come from the item content (content-based approach) or the user\u2019s social environment (CF). The use of these systems is becoming increasingly popular in the Internet because they are very useful to evaluate and filter the vast amount of information available on the Web in order to assist users in their search processes and retrieval. RSs have been highly used and play an important role in different Internet sites that offer products and services in social networks, such as Amazon, YouTube, Netflix, Yahoo!, TripAdvisor, Facebook, and Twitter, among others. Many different companies are developing RSs techniques as an added value to the services they provide to their subscribers.\n"

The course then delves into modern wide-area data processing, with an emphasis on recent systems developed to solve large-scale problems using clusters of commodity machines. In this second part, the course covers distributed storage systems (such as Google\u2019s BigTable), wide-area hash-tables (like Cassandra), data-intensive computing platforms (Hadoop) and nosql systems. Hands on programming exercises using those platforms will be an important part of this course.\n"

Modern Hash-base Structure \u2013 This is an important class of structure for point access. We will look into open addressing (cuckoo, swiss table) and close addressing (TBD) options.\n\t2. Scalable Trees \u2013 These structures cover in addition range access and we study examples of compact/efficient trees such as radix tree (ART) and concurrent access structures such as range index (Masstree)\n\t3. Persistent Structures \u2013 There are structures that lend themselves well to be operated in-memory but that present a persistent component. We will study structures with In-place updates (B-link* tree) and append-only (Log-Structured Merge Trees)\n\t4. Probabilistic Structures \u2013 We look into the use of approximation techniques into data structures. In particular, we look into compact set membership (Bloom Filter) and Approximate Balancing techniques (Skiplist).\n\t5. Compressed/Learned Structures \u2013 Similarly to approximation, compression also creates interesting possibilities. We look into lossless approaches in dictionary compression and lossy ones in learned Index (TBD).\n\t6. Each of the five modules is comprised of two classes. There are two classes reserved for student projects presentations.\n"

        "description": "Machine learning systems are often conventionally designed for centralized processing in that they first collect data from distributed sources and then execute algorithms on a single server. Due to the limited scalability of processing large amount of data and the long latency delay, there is a strong demand for a paradigm shift to distributed or decentralized ML systems which execute ML algorithms on multiple and in some cases even geographically dispersed nodes.\nThe aim of this course is to let students learn how to design and build distributed ML systems via paper reading, presentation, and discussion; We provide a broad overview on the design of the state-of-the-art distributed ML systems, with a strong focus on the scalability, resource efficiency, data requirements, and robustness of the solutions. We will present an array of methodologies and techniques that can efficiently scale ML analysis to a large number of distributed nodes against all operation conditions, e.g., system failures and malicious attacks. The specific course topics are listed below.\nThe course materials will be based on a mixture of classic and recently published papers.\n"

The core methods and algorithms are elaborated that enable pattern recognition for a wide range of data sources including sensory data (image, video, audio, location, etc.) as well as born-digital data (text, network traffic, chemical formulas, etc.). The course is organized in two parts. In the first part, we explore statistical pattern recognition based on feature vector representation. Standard methods for unsupervised clustering and supervised classification in vector spaces will be discussed. In the second part, we investigate structural pattern recognition based on string and graph representation. For clustering and classification of structural data, dissimilarity measures will be introduced alongside with explicit and implicit vector space embedding approaches. The course is accompanied by practical exercises that involve the implementation of algorithms discussed in class and their application to exemplary pattern recognition tasks.\n"
